## 📝 Next Steps to Upload:

### **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com
2. **Click the "+" icon** in top-right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in details:**
   - **Repository name:** `cipherstudio` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description:** "Full-stack code editor with authentication - MERN Stack"
   - **Visibility:** Public or Private (your choice)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

### **Step 2: Link Local Repo to GitHub**

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "c:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\Web Dev\codeEditor\vscode-clone"

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Example:
# git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/cipherstudio.git
```

### **Step 3: Push to GitHub**

```bash
# Push to GitHub (main branch)
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**OR if you're using master branch:**
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

---

## 🔐 If You Need Authentication:

### **Option 1: HTTPS (Recommended for beginners)**
1. GitHub will prompt for username and password
2. **Password:** Use a Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)

**Create Personal Access Token:**
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
4. Click "Generate token"
5. **Copy the token** and use it as password when pushing

### **Option 2: SSH (Advanced)**
1. Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
2. Add to GitHub account
3. Use SSH URL instead of HTTPS

---

## 📋 Complete Command Sequence:

Open your terminal and run these commands one by one:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd "c:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\Web Dev\codeEditor\vscode-clone"

# 2. Check status (verify all files are committed)
git status

# 3. Add remote (replace with YOUR GitHub URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cipherstudio.git

# 4. Verify remote
git remote -v

# 5. Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# 6. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

---

## ✨ Quick Copy-Paste Commands:

**After creating your GitHub repo, copy the commands it shows, which will look like:**

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
